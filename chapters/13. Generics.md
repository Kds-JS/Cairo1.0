# Generics

`Generics` provides a better robust wasy of writing code working with multiple data types without being tied to a specific type. With `generics` you can write more clean code without duplication and it provides type-safety as well. The concept of generics can be applied to functions, structs, enumerations etc in Cairo 1.0. 

In a function, a generic type is defined by adding placeholder type within angle brackets `< >` after the function name. Let us consider the below example:

```cairo
fn swap<T>(x: T, y: T) -> (T, T) {
    (y, x)
}

fn main() {
    let (two,one) = swap::<felt>(1, 2);
    let (two_128,one_128) = swap::<u128>(1_u128, 2_u128);
}
```
In the above example, we first define a function named `swap` which takes two parameters of type `T` and returns the swapped values. Notice `T` is wrapped in angle brackets as `<T>` in the `swap` function, that is how generics is used in a function. 

The `main ()` function above shows the true power of generics. The first swap in the `main ()` function performs a swap of type `felt252` and the second swap performs swap with data type `uint 128`. Notice how we did not have to define the swap function more than once explicitly defining type `felt252` and `uint128`. Normally, we would have to define two swap functions one with `felt252` data type and the other with `u128` data type.  

**Assignment**
Redefine the `swap` function above without using generics to perform a swap for both `felt252` and `u128` data types.
