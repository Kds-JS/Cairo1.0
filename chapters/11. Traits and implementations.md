# Traits and Implementations

In Cairo, `traits` and `implementations` are used to define and implement functionality that can be used across different `types`.

## Traits
Traits are very similar to interfaces in traditional Object Oriented(OO) languages, but with some key differences. 

You could think of a trait as a means to define an interface for a specific type.

We define a trait using the `trait` keyword followed by the name of the `trait`. In the trait block, we specify the signature of the functions that we want that specific trait to implement. 
Traits define a set of methods that must be implemented by any component that uses the trait. Here is an example of a simple trait definition in Cairo:

```cairo
trait Maths {
   fn add(x: u8, y: u8) -> u8;
}
```

This `trait`, called `Maths`, defines a single method called `add`. In other words we are saying that every `type` that uses this trait needs to implement the `add` function.

`traits` can contain multiple function signatures, for example, we can update the `trait`(Maths) above to:

```cairo
trait Maths {
   fn add(x: u8, y: u8) -> u8;
   fn subtract(x: u8, y: u8) -> u8;
   fn multiply(x: u8, y: u8) -> u8;
}
```

## Implementations
Implementations are used to define the behavior of a `type` that uses a `trait`. The `impl` keyword is used to define implementations on traits. 

Here is a simple implementation of the `Maths trait` above:

```cairo
impl MathImpl of Maths {
   fn add(x: u8, y: u8) -> u8 {
      x + y
   }

   fn subtract(x: u8, y: u8) -> u8 {
      x - y
   }

   fn multiply(x: u8, y: u8) -> u8 {
      x * y
   }
}
```

You could then call the defined traits from functions like this:

```cairo
fn main(x: u8, y: u8) -> u8 {
   Maths::add(x, y)
}
```
