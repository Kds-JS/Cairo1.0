# Option
Writing Provable programs necessitates that our programs are able to run as intended. Usually, when a Cairo program encounters an error, it throws a `panic`. However, it is sometimes desireable to catch failures of parts of our programs instead of calling `panic`. 

In cairo 1.0, there is the `Option` type which represents values that may or may not be present. The `Option` type is similar to that of Rust, as Cairo 1.0 is heavily borrowed from `Rust`. In cairo 1.0, the `Option` type just as is in Rust can be either `Some` or `None`. What this means is if a value is present it is wrapped in a variant `Some` and when absent it is wrapped in the variant `None`

Cairo 1.0 provides two methods `is_some` and `is_none` which is is used to check whether an `Option` contains a value or not. The `is_some` method returns `true` if an `Option` contains a value and `false` if it doesn't. Similarly, the `is_none` method returns `true` if the `Option` does not contain a value and `false` if it does contain a value. 

For proper understanding, let's consider the following example in Cairo 1.0:
```cairo
use option::OptionTrait;
use debug::PrintTrait;

fn main() {
    let some_value: Option<u8> = Some(1_u8);
    let none_value: Option<u8> = None(());
    if some_value.is_some() {
        ('The value is present').print();
    } else {
    ('The value is not present').print();
    }
    if none_value.is_none() {
    ('The value is not present').print();
    } else {
        ('The value is present').print();
    }
}
```
In the above example, our function `main` first creates two `Option` values, one with value called `some_value` and the other with no value called `none_value`
Then in the conditional statement, we use the `is_some` method to check if the value is present and `is_none` if the value is not present. In both conditions we print out a corresponding message. 

From this, we clearly see how in Cairo 1.0 `Option`, `is_some` and `is_none` provides the ability of writing reliable and robust programs through dealing with absent values.
