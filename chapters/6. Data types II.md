# Data Types: Enums and Pattern Matching

In this section, we would be looking into Enums and Pattern Matching.

## Enums

Enums are custom types that allow the creation of variants of a value under a single name.

Take, for instance, for an exam test, you are expected to either pass or fail and nothing else. Let's create an enum for that.

```cairo
enum ExamResult {
    Pass: (),
    Fail: ()
}
```

`Pass` and `Fail` has null(not a type in Cairo) types here. But, we could have an enum whose variants has different types. Like, so:

```cairo
enum Message {
    Quit: (),
    Echo: felt252,
    Move: (u32, u32),
    ChangeColor: (u8, u8, u8)
}
```

## Pattern Matching

Now, imagine remarks were being given to students, based on their exam results, in this case the `ExamResult` enum we mentioned above, the conventional way to do this would be using `if statements`, but here we would use `pattern matching` instead:

```cairo
use debug::PrintTrait;

fn give_remark(result: ExamResult){
    match result {
        ExamResult::Pass => {
            ('Congratulations. You passed').print()
        },
        ExamResult::Fail => {
            ('Sorry. You didn't make it').print()
        }
    }
}
```

- `use debug::PrintTrait` gives us access to the `print()` function.
